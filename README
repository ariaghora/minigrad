## Automatic gradient implementation in python

This repository demonstrates the implementation of automatic gradient (or simply autograd) computation in python, using only numpy as the backend. Autograd is commonly found in many neural network frameworks, such as pytorch and jax. This repository is created for pedagogical purpose and kept as minimum as possible.
