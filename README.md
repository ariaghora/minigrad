## Automatic gradient implementation in python

This repository demonstrates the implementation of automatic gradient computation in python (or simply autograd), using only numpy as the backend. Autograd is commonly found in many neural network frameworks, such as pytorch and jax. This repository is created for pedagogical purpose and kept as minimum as possible.
